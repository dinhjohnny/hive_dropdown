# Hive Frontend Engineer Challenge



## Functionality
- Created a drop-down component that allows users to select options, which are stored in React states for developer usage
- Users can open and close the drop-down menu
- Component supports single selected option or multiple selected options by specifying prop "multi_select" as true/false
    - Component has 3 props label, options, and multi_select
        - label: small label for the component
        - options: array of desired choices
        - multi_select: true allows multi-selection, false specifies single selection
    
- Selected options are visible when the dropdown is closed
- Added subtle highlighting and outlining when interacting for a more friendly UX
